# OpenCart-application-testing
OpenCart is an online store management system. It is PHP-based, using a MySQL database and HTML components. In this project I have tested two of its module called Register and Add to cart. After writing several test cases I have tested the demo application also made a Bug report which is suitable for solving the issues arised.
